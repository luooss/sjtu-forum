# SJTU Forum
A Spring project purely for learning purpose.

A possibly better student forum for SJTU in the future, but still too far behind to catch up with ShuiYuan Forum at the moment.

# Implementation
- Backend: Spring Boot, MyBatis.
- Frontend: Thymeleaf, jQuery, Bootstrap.
- Database: H2, MySQL, Flyway.
